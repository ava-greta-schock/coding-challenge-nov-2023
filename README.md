<h1 align="center">Welcome to PacWest's November Coding Challenge!</h1>
  
<div align="center"><i>The purpose of PacWest's monthly Coding Challenge is to create a constant opportunity for developers to upskill their coding abilities, cultivate accomplishments to reference during role discussions, and build SWE community engagement through fun and captivating projects.</i></div>

<hr>

:computer: We recommend you attempt the Full Stack challenge, but you can select the steps that best suits your commitment level. <b>You do not have to complete every step of the challenge to earn points.</b>

:dart: At the end of each month, each submission's points will be tallied by the PacWest team. Participants who show exceptional work in either a Full Stack, Frontend, or Backend capacity will be recognized in SWE's Monthly CoreTech meeting and the [Coding Challenge SharePoint](https://avanade.sharepoint.com/sites/PacWestSWE/SitePages/Greta%27s-Test-Page.aspx?OR=Teams-HL&CT=1695073757100&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMzA5MDExMjIyOSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOnRydWV9#exceptional-projects-in-september-s-coding-challenge)

:trophy: Points are tallied on a continuous basis. The top five participants will be listed in the [Coding Challenge leaderboard](https://avanade.sharepoint.com/sites/PacWestSWE/SitePages/Greta%27s-Test-Page.aspx?OR=Teams-HL&CT=1695073757100&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMzA5MDExMjIyOSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOnRydWV9#coding-challenge-leaderboard). For every 2000 points you earn through Coding Challenge, you will be awarded 2000 [GoTeam points](https://cloud.workhuman.com/microsites/t/home?client=avanade&setCAG=false)!

:dizzy: <b>Remember</b>: this is a time to challenge yourself, try out new tech, and have fun!

:email: Once completed, please submit your repository to pacwest@avanade.com. We will then send you a form to see how the challenge went.

            <div>Transform the existing landing page into a simple list of the National Parks names. Ultimately, when the user clicks on it a park name, it will lead the user to a new park-specific page. You must include all of the static components from Step Two of the frontend challenge (name, description, etc.) in each individual page.</div>
		<br>
		<div>Additionally, you will use the React function <a href="https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists" target="_blank">useState</a> to create the following interactive components for the user:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>A star icon to favorite a park. If the user clicks on a star icon, then the icon change format to indicate that it is favorited</li>
			<li>A badge that indicates the type of park (National Park, Historical Trail, etc.)</li>
			<li>A search feature located in the navigation bar based on park name</li>
			<li>A description on whether the park is in northern or southern California</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<div>HINT: Think about creating reusable components. Is it better to use Next.js pages, props, or both? What identifier can you utilize in the parks.json file to ensure that each component has its own key? You as the developer must decide.</div>
